# üõ°Ô∏è Cloud Security: Threat Hunting with AWS Network Firewall

## Project Overview

In today's digital landscape, cloud security is paramount as organizations migrate their infrastructure to cloud-based platforms. This project focuses on enhancing security by leveraging **AWS Network Firewall** to detect and block unauthorized network activities. The primary objective is to prevent potential infiltration attempts, especially by detecting non-TLS (unencrypted) traffic over TLS ports, such as port 443.

## üìã Objectives

1. **Create a Firewall Rule Group**: Detect non-TLS traffic traversing over TLS ports (e.g., port 443) to prevent malicious activity.
2. **Monitor Firewall Activity**: Utilize AWS Network Firewall monitoring and Amazon CloudWatch Logs to investigate and respond to suspicious network traffic.

## üõ†Ô∏è Solution Approach

### Scenario
Imagine a scenario where we've noticed suspicious unauthorized network activity, including potential infiltration attempts by hackers. The goal is to take immediate action to block their access and protect our confidential information.

### Solution
To address this issue:
- **Step 1**: Configure an AWS Network Firewall rule group to specifically detect non-TLS traffic over TLS ports (port 443).
- **Step 2**: Focus on detecting non-TLS TCP traffic traversing over port 443, helping us effectively identify and block potential infiltration attempts.
- **Step 3**: Monitor network activities using Amazon CloudWatch Logs for real-time alerts on any unauthorized access attempts.

This solution adds a strong defense layer to our network by filtering out malicious traffic and protecting sensitive data.

## üöÄ Steps Taken

1. **Configured AWS Network Firewall**:
   - Created firewall rule groups to detect suspicious traffic over port 443.
   - Integrated AWS CloudWatch Logs for comprehensive monitoring.

2. **Testing**:
   - Simulated non-TLS traffic within the network to verify detection.
   - Used `curl` and `openssl` commands to test legitimate and suspicious traffic scenarios.
   - Confirmed the firewall's effectiveness by monitoring CloudWatch logs for unauthorized access attempts.

## üñºÔ∏è Diagram Explanation

1. **Distributed Deployment**: In this solution, the AWS Network Firewall is deployed in a distributed deployment model into each Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) that requires internet-bound traffic protection.

2. **VPC Overview**: A VPC serves as an isolated virtual network environment on AWS. This solution's VPC is connected to the internet through an internet gateway, allowing inbound traffic.

3. **Subnet Tiers**: 
   - The VPC contains three subnet tiers: **firewall**, **public**, and **private subnets**.
   - Each subnet is associated with a route table, which determines how traffic flows in and out of the subnet.

4. **Firewall Subnet**: 
   - AWS Network Firewall is deployed as a managed firewall in the firewall subnet using firewall endpoints.
   - The firewall acts as a security layer, protecting resources within the VPC from network threats.

5. **NAT Gateways**:
   - Deployed in the public subnets, the primary purpose of NAT gateways is to provide outbound internet connectivity for resources in the private subnets.
   - NAT gateways act as a bridge between a private subnet and the internet, ensuring secure communication while hiding the private IP addresses of the resources.

6. **Private Subnet Route Tables**:
   - Route tables for the private subnets direct all outbound traffic to the NAT gateway, enabling secure internet access for resources in private subnets.

7. **Public Subnet Route Tables**:
   - Route tables for public subnets direct all incoming traffic to the Network Firewall endpoint, ensuring that traffic is inspected and filtered before entering the public subnets.

8. **Firewall Subnet Route Table**:
   - The route table for the firewall subnet directs all traffic to the internet gateway, allowing outbound internet access from the firewall subnet.

9. **Ingress Route Table**:
   - This is a specialized route table with an internet gateway edge association, routing inbound traffic through the Network Firewall endpoint for inspection.

10. **Network Firewall Rule Groups**:
    - Specific rule groups are created with user-defined rules. For example, a rule might alert on suspicious TCP traffic over port 443 that is not using the TLS protocol. These rule groups are attached to the firewall policy.

11. **Logging with CloudWatch**:
    - Network Firewall can be configured to send logs to Amazon CloudWatch Logs once logging is enabled.
    - Logs are delivered to a log group in streams, with each stream containing an hour's worth of log records.

12. **Traffic Filtering**:
    - The rule groups can be further edited to drop any suspicious traffic identified. For example, a rule that alerts on non-TLS traffic over port 443 can be modified to block such traffic.

## üìù Suricata Rule Strings

### Alert Rule
The following Suricata rule detects traffic on port 443 that is not using the TLS protocol:

```suricata
alert tcp any any <> any 443 (msg:"SURICATA Port 443 but not TLS"; flow:to_server,established; app-layer-protocol:!tls; sid:2271003; rev:1;)

### Drop Rule

```suricata
drop tcp any any <> any 443 (msg:"SURICATA Port 443 but not TLS"; flow:to_server,established; app-layer-protocol:!tls; sid:2271003; rev:1;)


## üß™ Test Simulation Commands

### Non-TLS Test
\`\`\`bash
echo "Non-TLS test traffic" | nc -w 3 142.250.190.78 443
\`\`\`

### HTTPS Request Test
\`\`\`bash
curl -v https://www.example.com
\`\`\`

### TLS Handshake Verification
\`\`\`bash
openssl s_client -connect www.google.com:443
\`\`\`

- **Expected Result**: Look for `Verify return code: 0 (ok)` to confirm a successful TLS handshake.

## üìä Monitoring & Logs
The AWS Network Firewall activity was logged and monitored using **Amazon CloudWatch**, which provided insights into network traffic and potential threats.
